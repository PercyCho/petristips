# Holding

## Overview
In this file I will be talking about the hold function and its uses as well as when and what to hold.

## What is holding?
Holding is, well, holding a piece for use later. You store a piece to the hold, and then later, you can switch out your current piece with your held piece. This can be used to get rid of a nasty piece or to bring out a useful one. The strategy for holding is different in Petris than Tetris, and I will cover this at the end of the file.

## Strategy Number One: The Booster
I'm not sure what to call this one. It's a standard strategy among Tetris players though. This strategy goes along with my winstacking document (LINK LATER), where you save an I piece (either 4 or 5 length) and deploy it to get a Tetris or a Pentris. This can be used for a free 1200 or 3000 points. However, there is a downside, which is that it's much harder to actually use this strategy well in Petris. It's too difficult to get 4 or 5 solid lines with a slot at the end for an I piece, which is why winstacking and boost holding is much more difficult.

To use the booster, take the first I piece (4 or 5 length) and hold it.
