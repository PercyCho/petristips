# Petris Basic Overview

## Overview of this section

Welcome to the Petris Tips Repository, also called the PTR! In this repository I will be listing a bunch of tips and pieces of advice from the creator himself. This repository is divided into different files so you may skip and go about as you like. In this section I will be going over basic things such as the controls and what is on the website. As the website gets updated the PTR will be as well. Feel free to skip around, but I'd recommend going in basic -> intermediate -> advanced order. Without any further ado, let's get started!

## Controls

The most important thing to get used to on Petris is the controls. I've compiled a list for you. These are the official standard Tetris controls so nothing unfamiliar. If you forget, they're also on the website lol

* ü°ê/ü°í or A/D: Move piece left or right
* ü°ë: Rotate piece counterclockwise
* ü°ì: Move down 1 tile (also known as Soft Drop)
* Spacebar: Move the piece instantly down as far as it can go (also known as Hard drop)
* C: Hold piece for use later

The controls are easy to memorize. They're super intutive.

## Other things to note

There is a next piece viewer. Use this to plan ahead. In future documents I will describe how to use the next piece viewer to help you in your game. There is also a held piece viewer where you can see your held piece, and I will describe how to use that to your benefit as well in future documents.
Towards the bottom, there is a big button that says Information. You can click it and receive lots of information about the game, also written by me. I won't include it here because it's a bit lengthy.

## Conclusion

Well that's it for this document! I know it was short but there's really not a lot to cover. In future documents I will try to add more stuff so it's a bit more information. Otherwise, keep checking the PTR for new documents which should be coming out every few days!
