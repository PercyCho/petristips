# The Pieces

## Overview

In Petris, there are 19 different pieces, and it's good to be familiar with all the pieces. There are 7 4-block pieces and 12 5-block pieces. In this section I will go over each of the pieces, but not how they work with each other, which will be covered in another file.

## Favorable and unfavorable pieces
