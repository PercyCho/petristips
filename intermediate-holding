# Holding

## Overview
In this file I will be talking about the hold function and its uses as well as when and what to hold.

## What is holding?
Holding is, well, holding a piece for use later. You store a piece to the hold, and then later, you can switch out your current piece with your held piece. This can be used to get rid of a nasty piece or to bring out a useful one. The strategy for holding is different in Petris than Tetris, and I will cover this at the end of the file.
